# SQL JOINS & UNION - PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides SQL scripts and sample CSV datasets to help you understand and practice different types of **SQL JOINS** and **UNION** operations. These queries are essential for working with relational databases and efficiently combining data from multiple tables.

## 🔥 What You'll Learn
- **INNER JOIN** – Returns only the matching records from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN USING UNION** – Returns all records from both tables, filling missing values with NULL.

## 📂 Files Included
- **SQL Scripts**
  - `INNER JOIN.sql` – Query for INNER JOIN
  - `LEFT JOIN.sql` – Query for LEFT JOIN
  - `RIGHT JOIN.sql` – Query for RIGHT JOIN
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN USING UNION.sql` – Query for FULL OUTER JOIN using UNION

- **Sample Data (CSV)**
  - `Emp-Tab.csv` – Sample employee records
  - `Dept-Tab.csv` – Sample department records
